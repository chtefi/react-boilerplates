# 7. Let's add some code Linting

## What packages to install to do linting ?

We have multiple choices.

- JSLint : original project
- JSHint : fork of JSLint
- ESLint : new recent alternative (2013), pluggable

We are going to stick with ESLint because it supports React.

## Your text editor / IDE supports linting on-the-fly
